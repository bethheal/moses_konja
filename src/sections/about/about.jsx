        Iâ€™m the CEO and Founder of Mr Kay AGRO Consult, located in Ashanti
        Mampong. The company started by selling hybrid germinated oil palm
        seeds to smallholder oil palm farmers until we realized that the
        farmers' knowledge in nursery establishment was very poor.
        <br />
        <br />
        To address this, we decided to raise the germinated seeds into
        seedlings through nursery establishment and sell the seedlings
        instead of the germinated seeds. This approach has greatly
        enhanced the success of smallholder farmers in the region.
